## 📚 Description

This is my delivery for **Semester Project 2** at Noroff. The task was to apply the skills acquired over the past semesters to build an **auction website** using the [Noroff API V2](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2).

The project adheres to the technical constraints approved by the company's CTO and implements the following user stories:

1. A user with a `stud.noroff.no` email may register
2. A registered user may login
3. A registered user may logout
4. A registered user may update their avatar
5. A registered user may view their total credit
6. A registered user may view bids made on a listing
7. A registered user may create a listing with a title, deadline, media, and description
8. A registered user may bid on another user's listing
9. An unregistered user may search listings
