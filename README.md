## :books: Description

This is my delivery for **Semester Project 2** at Noroff. The task was to apply the skills acquired over the past semesters to build an **auction website** using the [Noroff API V2](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2).

The project adheres to the technical constraints approved by the company's CTO and implements the following user stories:

1. A user with a `stud.noroff.no` email may register
2. A registered user may login
3. A registered user may logout
4. A registered user may update their avatar
5. A registered user may view their total credit
6. A registered user may view bids made on a listing
7. A registered user may create a listing with a title, deadline, media, and description
8. A registered user may bid on another user's listing
9. An unregistered user may search listings

## :globe_with_meridians: API

This project uses the [Noroff API V2](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2) for all user and auction-related functionality.

## :rocket: Live Version

[Bid Society](https://bid-society.netlify.app/)

<br><br>

## :computer: Testing

If you want to test site you can visit the live version. You have to register a user fulfilling these criterias:

- Name must be 8 or more characters
- E-mail has to end with stud.noroff.no
- Password needs to be at least 8 characters and include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, a number and a sign

When you have registered a user you're free to visit and use all features on the app.
If you would like to update your avatar or create a listing, please note that your media must be an an open sourced URL. I would recommend using [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) for testing.
